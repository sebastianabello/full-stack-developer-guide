# Developer Full-Stack

This is a small guide on topics to be discussed by a full stack developer, I made this guide by guiding myself through different YouTube channels or documentation, the main idea is that anyone who wants to review in order basic and intermediate concepts of different technologies can do so with this repository, since in each folder and each file there are comments (in Spanish) to know what is done in that code, you can also play with it by changing things, this repository is constantly updated since they are topics that I am reviewing and I It helps myself to learn about these technologies.

## HTML & CSS

-This guide is going to start with html and css topics, most of them related to it, if I find a way to also put frameworks and make small annotations I will do it, keep in mind that it is based on what I have read and studied, if you have any annotation or something that is not like that, let me know and I will gladly change it, thank you very much for seeing the repository, I know that it will be very useful for you so as not to forget some useful things.
